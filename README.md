Syntax highlighting for 65816, SuperFX and SPC700 assembly, for the vim text editor.

May or may not work with your prefered theme, these were designed for a slightly modified version of wombat256 (need to add hi Directive for proper directive highlighting unless default colour is fine).

### Installing
Put the four .vim files in /syntax into your vimfiles/syntax directory.
** or with Pathogen**
Clone this repo into your ~/vimfiles/bundle directory.

### Using
:setf snes for 65816+SuperFX
:setf gsu for SuperFX
:setf spc700 for spc700
